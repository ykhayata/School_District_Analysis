# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

  Maria has asked me to complete an analysis on the school district she currently works at, and wants me to demonstrate how replacing specific scores will affect the orginal analysis. There has been some academic dishonesty concerning Thomas High School 9th graders, so we were asked to replace some of the scores to provide a more accurate analysis of the overall school district. Below, I will demonstrate the changes before/after replacing the scores with the use of pandas and numpy libraries. Stay tuned for the comparisons.

## Results 

1: How is the district summary affected?
 
    Suprisingly, we only see a 0.1% drop in avg math scores between the two results.
